  #This is odd because of the way I have the mnemonic routing set up.
  #    Essentially, if you leave this alone, it catches the /Departments/foo call and tries to route it to the show action of 
  #    a Department with id 'foo.'  Now it catches the call differently, so GET /departments/foo will go to the CMS page for foo
  #    and GET /departments/shard/:id will route to the department record for foo.
